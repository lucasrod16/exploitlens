# exploitlens

A simple, lightweight vulnerability scanner that reports if CVEs are present in the [CISA KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) database.

Checking for the presense of CVEs in the CISA KEV database is useful for choosing which vulnerabilities to prioritize for remediation.

Uses [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) to perform the scan.

## Usage

### Build from source

```bash
make build
```

### Scan a container image

```bash
./build/exploitlens golang:1.21.4
```

If there are CVEs discovered that are present in the CISA KEV database, the output will look similar to:

```bash
*** WARNING: These are known exploited vulnerabilities ***
NAME            INSTALLED  FIXED-IN  TYPE  VULNERABILITY   SEVERITY
libnghttp2-14   1.52.0-1             deb   CVE-2023-44487  High
linux-libc-dev  6.1.55-1             deb   CVE-2021-3864   High
```
